				Welcome to the <a href="http://usik.org/joomla/" target="_blank">United Southern Isshinryu Karate</a> app. This site is dedicated to all Isshinryu martial artists living in the 
				South. Some of us are affiliated with an established Isshinryu organization and some choose not to be affiliated. The 
				important thing is we all practice Isshinryu karate and we respect others that are traveling down the same chosen path.
				<br><br>
				<b>Our Mission:</b>  To promote the philosophy, ideals and history of Isshinryu karate set forth by Soke Tatsuo Shimabuku 
				through the traditional instruction of kata, kobudo and self-defense in order to enhance the individual and personal 
				growth of its practitioners.
				<br><br>
				<b>Vision (Statement):</b>  Although we may come from different backgrounds and lineage, the simple fact is we are all part of 
				the Isshinryu family. We have an open door policy that admits any Isshinryu school that exhibits; a desire to 
				participate in seminars or workouts; the open mindedness to share their knowledge and talents; a sincere respect for 
				seniors, peers and fellow students.
