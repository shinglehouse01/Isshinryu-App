		<strong>The ear must listen in all directions</strong>
		<br><br>
		Hearing is a valuable sense that is on automatically but is seldom used to its fullest capacity. Most problems or situations occur when we don't pay enough attention to what we hear. In a confrontation we need to listen to what is being said, how it is being said and the tone of the voice. In a physical confrontation we need to listen to the breathing pattern, whether it is hard or soft. We need to listen to their movements whether they are stepping or sliding their feet.
		<br>
		The more senses that we use in a conflict the better the decision making process becomes.
