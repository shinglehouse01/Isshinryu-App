		<strong>The body should be able to change directions at any time</strong>
		<br><br>
		Having a set or standard defense or offense is normal. However, life is not just black and white. Change is inevitable and you should be able to change whenever the situation warrants it. A defensive fighter prefers to let their opponent come to them just like an offensive fighter prefers to initiate the confrontation. Depending on the circumstances or the opponent, you should be able to adapt to the situation at hand. This means being able to change your tactics from defensive to offensive, linear to angular or soft to hard.
