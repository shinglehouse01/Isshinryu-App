		<strong>A person's unbalance is the same as a weight</strong>
		<br><br>
		Preparedness is essential in everything that we do in life. A martial artist needs to have the skill sets necessary to handle a variety of situations. Balance refers not only to the physical but also to the mental state. The skill sets required to be a good martial artist include being mentally prepared to handle situations that arise. The body and the mind need to act in unison to overcome any and all opponents.
