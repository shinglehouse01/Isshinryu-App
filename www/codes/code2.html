		<strong>The blood circulating is similar to the moon and sun</strong>
		<br><br>
		Just as the moon and the sun are in constant motion so should we as martial artists be in motion. We should not settle for the knowledge or abilities that we have but should always strive to continue to learn and progress. Perfection is a goal that we all try to attain but it takes continuous work and it is always just out of reach.
