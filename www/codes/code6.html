		<strong>The time to strike is when the opportunity presents itself</strong>
		<br><br>
		Opportunities come up daily. Sometimes, they are veiled in a negative manner as in problems. Problems are things that come up and test our abilities to cope. Each problem as it is worked through gives us a new perspective on how to react, endure or solve a certain situation. We should take the good things that occur in our lives in stride and be grateful. Enjoy these times and take advantage of them. When life hits a sour note, work through the difficulty and don't dwell on the negative. View everyday as a new opportunity to develop into a better person and martial artist.
