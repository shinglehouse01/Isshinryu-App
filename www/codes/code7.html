		<strong>The eye must see all sides</strong>
		<br><br>
		We live in a very visual world. Our reactions, whether positive or negative, are outcomes of what we see or to put it better what we think that we see. Most of our outlooks are based on the obvious. We need to look at things from all perspectives. This means not just through our own eyes but through the eyes of your opponent or adversary and through the eyes of someone outside the boundaries of the conflict. It is truly at that point that we see the whole picture and the solutions become clear.
