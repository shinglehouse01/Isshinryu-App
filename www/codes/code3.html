		Situations that arise can be handled in a variety of ways. Conflicts can be taken care of through negotiations or with a physical response. Negotiations come in two varieties. The first is one where all parties walk away feeling like each has won. The second way is to give an ultimatum with a threat attached if something is not settled in a timely manner or with the desired results.  Even with physical responses, there are two possible scenarios. One in which the force used is only the amount necessary to convey to your opponent that it is wiser to submit because you have superior skills that could lead to their physical discomfort or worst.  The other is to strike with so much force that the end result leaves little to the imagination.
