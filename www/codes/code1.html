		<strong>A Person's heart is the same as heaven and earth</strong>

		This code refers directly to harmony. In the martial arts, your body needs to know the techniques applicable to maintain harmony in your life. This means being able to defend yourself if necessary in order to restore peace. Most of the time if you feel confident in your abilities, the tranquility that you exhibit in difficult situations comes through and alleviates the need for escalation in physical conflict.
