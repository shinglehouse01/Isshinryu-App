				I come to you with only KARATE, my empty hands. I have no weapons. But should I be forced to defend myself, my

				The Creed is a code of ethics authored by Grandmaster Ed Parker. A creed is a system of beliefs, principles, or 
				opinions. These are our beliefs.
				<br><br>
				<strong><u>Explanation of the Creed</u></strong>
				<br><br>
				<u>I come to you with only karate, my empty hands. I have no weapons</u>
				<br>
				I come with empty hands offering peace. I have no weapons. My heart is pure and my wish is not to fight.
				<br><br>
				<u>but should I be forced to defend myself</u>
				<br>
				If attacked or threatened and having no other option, I will use my weapons, my empty hands.
				<br><br>
				<u>my principles or my honor, should it be a matter of life or death, right or wrong,</u>
				<br>
				Those beliefs I hold precious; such as my family, the sick and poor, and children - I will defend with all of my 
				ability, regardless of the odds or how hopeless the cause.
				<br><br>
				<u>then here are my weapons, karate, my empty hands</u>
				<br>
				I will use only my karate in defense of life. I will use my karate for only the right reasons, not for wrong ones.
				<br><br>
				"War and Killing are wrong, but so it is wrong not to be prepared to defend one's self. They have taken our weapons, but we still have our bodies. We have no knives; so make every fist into a mace. Without spears every arm must be a spear and every open hand a sword." Daruma 28th Buddha
