		   <h3>Dojo Procedures</h3>
		   	<ul class="ui-listview ui-listview-inset ui-corner-all ui-shadow" data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
				<li>As you enter the Dojo, a respectable bow is to be given to show your spirit and readiness to train.</li>
				<li>When entering the Dojo, say either Konnichi-Wa (good day), or Komban-Wa (good evening on meeting) Sensei.  When leaving, say Sayonara (good bye) or O-Yasumi Nasai (good night upon parting) Sensei.</li>
				<li>A respectable bow is to be given whenever entering or exiting the Dojo floor.</li>
				<li>If you enter class late, do not enter the floor, rather stand at attention until the instructor acknowledges your presence by bowing to you.</li>
				<li>When a Sensei enters the Dojo floor for the first time, the first student that sees him is to loudly state:"ush" (stop).  At that time every student is to stand at attention and bow to the Sensei.</li>
				<li>All Black Belt Instructors are to be addressed by their surname and the title of: Mr., Mrs., Ms., etc.   (example: Mr. Brown or Ms. Jones). SAN Dans (Third Degree Black Belt) and above may be addressed as "Sensei". ROKU Dan (Sixth Degree Black Belt) through HAICHI Dan (Eight Degree Black Belt) wear a Red and White Belt, and may be addressed as "Master" or "Sensei". KU DAN (9th Degree Black Belt) and JU Dan (Tenth Degree Black Belt)  wear a solid Red Belt, and may be addressed as "Grand Master" or "Sensei".</li>
				<li>Students are responsible for the techniques and forms that they are taught.  At any time you may be asked to perform them.  You learn by SEEING, LISTENING, QUESTIONING AND DOING.</li>
				<li>It is up to everyone to help keep the Dojo clean.  Inquire to see if help is needed in cleaning the Dojo.</li>
				<li>Always respect your Sensei.  Pay close attention to what he has to say at all times.  Each student should bow to the Sensei before and after each class.  Remember that true Karate begins and ends with courtesy.</li>
				<li>During the time spent in class you should be thinking of improving your ability in Karate but you learn more when you enjoy what you are doing.  Find ways that will help you to do both (improve and enjoy).</li>
