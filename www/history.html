					Master Shinkichi (Tatsuo) Shimabuku was born on September 19,1908, and began his study of 
					karate (Shuri-te) as a boy with his uncle, Irshu Matsumora. Master Shimabuku would eventually 
					train under three great Okinawan masters: Chotoku Kyan, Chojun Miyagi and Choki Motobu, 
					ultimately becoming an acknowledged expert in both the Goju-Ryu and Shorin-Ryu systems. Over 
					time, he refined techniques and concepts from both systems to form Isshinryu (One Heart Way) 
					on January 15th, 1954.
					<br><br>
					Chotoku Kyan was a student of Master Yasutune Itosu, who taught 
					Shuri-te, and of, Master Matsumora, who taught Tomari-te. These two styles were combined to 
					form Shorin-Ryu. He was famous for his powerful kicks, and for his outstanding teaching ability. 
					Kyan was a stern perfectionist, and young Tatsuo Shimabuku achieved the honor of being his 
					best student.
					<br><br>
					Chojun Miyagi was the number one student of the Naha-te grandmaster, Kanryo 
					Higashionna. Miyagi was known as an exacting sensei whose grueling workouts greatly strengthened 
					the body and built up endurance. Miyagi placed great emphasis on breathing and tension, 
					low kicks, and the development of mind, body and spirit.
					<br><br>
					Choki Motobu was a less formal instructor, but an accomplished master in Shorin-Ryu, and an indomitable fighter. 
					Coming from an ancient line of Okinawan nobles, he had an eccentric personality and an enormous 
					physique. He is remembered as a brawler as well as a master, teaching both street and classic 
					techniques.
					<br><br>
					Under these three sensei's, Tatsuo Shimabuku developed abilities that mutually 
					complemented one another in making him a quintessential karate-ka. With additional training 
					from Okinawan weapon experts, Tiara Shinken and Yabu Moden, Tatsuo Shimabuku became one of the 
					most accomplished karate-ka of his day.
					<br><br>
					From the late 1920's to the 1940's, Master Shimabuku's prestige and authority in karate increased. Like most of the Okinawan population, Master 
					Shimabuku was a poor farmer, who also worked in his village as a tax collector. With the advent 
					of World War II, and the forced conscription of thousands of Okinawan men, Master Shimabuku and 
					his family sought refuge on another island.
					<br><br>
					After the Japanese were defeated, the Americans occupied Okinawa and began a massive effort of reconstruction. Having returned to Okinawa, 
					Master Shimabuku resumed farming, until American servicemen began to seek him out for 
					instruction in karate. In the early 1950's, Master Shimabuku decided to establish a formal dojo 
					at his home in Chun Village, and later moving the dojo to Agena.
					<br><br>
					Master Shimabuku was both innovative and visionary in his approach to karate. He spent years synthesizing the techniques 
					and concepts of Shorin-Ryu and Goju-Ryu into Isshinryu, including the innovative use of the 
					vertical fist punch, low kicks, natural stances/movements, snap techniques and hard/soft 
					applications. Master Shimabuku often stated that there was "no birthday" for Isshinryu, 
					because it was a dynamic/work-in-progress.
					<br><br>
					Four former U.S. Marines are credited with bringing Isshinryu to the United States: Harold Mitchum, Harold Long, Don Nagle and Steve Armstrong. 
					Master Tatsuo Shimabuku died May 30, 1975 in Okinawa.
